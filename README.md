### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Mike and i'm one of the best Python developer...in the future, ofc. :satisfied:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studing at YandexPracticum, Python backend developer section.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and it's tools as mentioned above.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m still learning how to update my GitHub profile and just checking some new features.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Everything in Python is an object. But how to prove it? Easy:
```
if isinstance('anything', object):
  print('If anything is an object -> everything is an object')
```
